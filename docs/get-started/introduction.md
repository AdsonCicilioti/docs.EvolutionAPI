# Introduction

## INTRODUTION OF THE EVOLUTION API

This is a COMPLETELY FREE project, which aims to reach small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, self-employed professionals and people with low purchasing power, but who want to increase their local or digital business with a WhatsAppâ„¢ messaging solution via API.

The content of this documentation was created seeking to be easy to interpret and execute even for users who are unfamiliar with technical procedures or systems. There was an attempt to be as didactic as possible, predicting errors and already pointing out the likely solutions.

We kindly ask you to try to carefully follow the proposed step-by-step, because in the countless tests we performed here, we didn't have any failures in the installation.

If you have any questions, you can ask them on our Discord Channel, which was created exclusively for people interested in Evolution-API, visiting the link https://evolution-api.com/discord.

## IMPORTANT RECOMENTATIONS

#### Please, CAREFULLY READ ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS BELOW BEFORE BEGINNING THE INSTALLATION:

1. This script was created using as a base the DEBIAN distribution, version 11 LTS 64bits.
2. Tests were not carried out on other distributions, versions or VPS's other than Hetzner.
3. A clean VPS was used, without any other app or service installed, to avoid any kind of conflict that has nothing to do with the Evolution API.
4. We do not recommend or encourage local installation, regardless of the operating system.
5. We do not recommend or encourage installation without using the reverse proxy, where access is done through IP + Port information. Eg: http://0.0.0.0:8080, where "0.0.0.0" represents the your local or public IPv4 address.
6. We had reports of users who managed to install normally in several other scenarios. Whether in other providers, local installation, installation in Windows, use and access without reverse proxy, etc., but in some cases it was necessary to release ports, use apps additional or other settings that are not reported in this Tutorial.
7. In this case, IT IS AT THE USER'S OWN DISCRETION AND RESPONSIBILITY any attempt that does not follow procedures detailed in this Tutorial.
